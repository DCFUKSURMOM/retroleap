Original Xbox (requires cromwell bios or some other method of loading linux):

make retroleap-xbox_defconfig

make menuconfig (optional, change whatever you want to change here - adding cores, etc.)

make linux-menuconfig (optional, used to tweak the kernel config, if linux-menuconfig does not work try linux-nconfig.)

make (you can add -jX (where x is the number of cpu threads) to this to speed up builds, it is recommended to not set all available threads to avoid locking up your system (-j2 on a 4 core, 4 thread cpu for example, although im a massochist and i personally do -j3)

kernel and rootfs images will be in output/images (bzImage, rootfs.tar)

Xbox Install instructions (for cromwell bios):

This has been tested in the XEMU Xbox emulator (https://xemu.app https://github.com/xemu-project/xemu), I do not own an actual xbox to test on

Unlock your Xbox hard drive from the settings in Cromwell

Remove the hard drive from your Xbox and connect it to your computer using an IDE to USB adapter

Make sure your xbox hard drive has an MBR/DOS partition table

Create a 20M fat partition as the first partition on your Xbox hard drive, make sure its marked as bootable/active

Mount the partition and copy bzImage and linuxboot.cfg (in board/retroleap/xbox/boot) to it

Create an ext4 or btrfs partition as the second partition on your Xbox hard drive (leave some space free at the end if you want a swap partition, recommended size is 256M)

Mount the partition and copy rootfs.tar to it as root

Switch to the directory you mounted the root at

Extract the rootfs tar as root with tar xvpf rootfs.tar

Remove rootfs.tar when it finishes

Create a swap partition (optional but recommended) as the third partition on your Xbox hard drive, recommended size is 256M

Switch to the directory you mounted the root to and edit etc/fstab to include this:
/dev/sda3	none		swap	defaults	0	0

Unmount all partitions and put the hard drive back into the Xbox

Boot your Xbox, the kernel may take a while to start, this is a known issue.
